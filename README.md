Stock Market Price Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to forecast stock price movements using historical data. By leveraging advanced data preprocessing and predictive modeling techniques, the model helps analyze trends to make better-informed decisions.

Overview
The primary focus of this project is to predict stock price changes (upward or downward movement) based on historical data inputs. It incorporates various steps, such as feature engineering, training machine learning algorithms, and evaluating model performance for accurate predictions.

Project Features
Stock Movement Prediction: Forecast price direction (increase or decrease) using historical trends.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features.
Modeling: Uses machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Regressor for predictions.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates accuracy with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Dataset
The dataset used includes historical stock market data with the following attributes:

Date: Time of stock entry.
Stock Price: Historical closing prices.
Volume: Trading volume data.
Target Variable: Encoded direction of price movement (up or down).
üìÅ Dataset location: dataset/stock_data.csv

Note: Ensure you have Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) installed to manage large datasets effectively. Git LFS Documentation.

Technologies Used
The project is implemented using the following tools and libraries:

Python
pandas and numpy for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning modeling
joblib for saving and loading models
Git LFS for handling large datasets
